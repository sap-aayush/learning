// the simple arithmetic operators of the c/c++ are here too but with some changes

// like the divide operator don't give the int data type rather directly in the decimals

// also if for two number two times * is used then it works as the power


let a = 45 , b = 487

console.log(b/a)
console.log(b**a)

// coparison operators also present but with some extra things

// == as it is , but ===  tells that value equals along with the data type 

let x = 6
let y = "6"

console.log(x==y)  // true
console.log(x===y) // false
