// if we want to modify the element via JS then we get the eleemtn by various things
// so in order to select the object we do it by the DOM manipulation


// DOM tree done...............

// there are main 3 types of the nodes in the DOM

// text   --> act as the leaf ; can't be ath in it
//element
//comment   

// if the  HTML element is encountered by the browser then if there are any errors present in it then it is auto corrected

// like if any thing is placed outside the bofy then it is placed in it

// similarly if the opening and the closing tag of an elemnt are different then it auto corrects

document.documentElement //--> returns the HTML document and it is of the object type

document.title  // --> gives the title of the page and it is of the type string

// if any tg is accesed before it is written then null is returned
